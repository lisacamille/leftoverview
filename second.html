        I like to collect, then forget about my collections, and after days, maybe years, or other time frames, I stumble upon them. This act of remembering all of those forgotten collections then gives me, has a huge nostalgic value, and also acts as a marker of a certain time. 
        Each collection has its time frame, which is more or less present meanwhile collecting material, or immaterial artefacts. What each collection has in common is something like a box, a frame in which it gets collected, which is also loosened from the visible box because there are also immaterial ways that carry a collection, and this carrier is sometimes ethereal, sometimes a very physical thing is also connected to its content. The connection between the collection and its carrier is something that grows organically and doesnâ€™t need an explanation, it's intentional. 
        This carrier and this collection can have the meaning of a shrine. A website can be this carrier of things and can be shaped in the way the contents need it. Can be very present and act as a storyteller about its content, or just give a space where the content is allowed to be. 
        This potential of defining the carrier's shape meanwhile collecting its contents and growing each organically is a beautiful and natural way of building a personal shrine, a marker, or a memory.
